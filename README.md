# AI Scraping Project

## Overview

The **AI Scraping** project is a Python-based web scraping solution leveraging AI models and natural language processing. This project is designed for extracting and parsing structured or unstructured data from websites efficiently. It combines the power of tools like Selenium for browser automation, BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing, and LangChain for advanced AI-driven parsing and processing.

---

## Key Features

- **Web Scraping Automation**: Automates browsing and data extraction using Selenium.
- **AI-Powered Data Processing**: Utilizes LangChain for advanced AI parsing and decision-making.
- **HTML Parsing**: Extracts and processes web page content using BeautifulSoup and lxml.
- **Environment Configuration**: Supports dotenv for managing API keys and other secrets.

## Project Files

### 1. `main.py`
This is the entry point for the application, coordinating scraping and data processing tasks.

#### Key Components:
- **Initialization**:
  - Loads configurations from `.env` using `python-dotenv`.
  - Sets up the scraping environment with Selenium.
- **Scraping Process**:
  - Navigates to target URLs.
  - Extracts content dynamically loaded by JavaScript.
- **Integration with AI**:
  - Sends scraped content to LangChain modules for AI-driven parsing.
- **Output**:
  - Generates structured data output (e.g., JSON, CSV).

#### Example Code:
```python
from selenium import webdriver
from langchain import LLMChain

# Initialize Selenium WebDriver
browser = webdriver.Chrome()
browser.get("http://example.com")

# Process content with LangChain
llm_chain = LLMChain(...) # Example chain setup
parsed_content = llm_chain.run(raw_html)
```

### 2. `parse.py`
This module handles parsing and processing of scraped content.

#### Key Functions:
- **HTML Parsing**:
  - Uses BeautifulSoup to extract data points (e.g., titles, links, tables).
- **AI Integration**:
  - Sends extracted data chunks to LangChain for natural language processing.
- **Utility Functions**:
  - Cleans and structures raw HTML data into meaningful insights.

#### Example Code:
```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def parse_html(html):
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
    titles = soup.find_all('h1')
    return [title.text for title in titles]
```

### 3. `requirements.txt`
Lists the dependencies for the project. To install them, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Dependencies:
- **Streamlit**: For building interactive dashboards.
- **LangChain**: AI-powered language processing.
- **Selenium**: Browser automation.
- **BeautifulSoup**: HTML parsing.
- **lxml and html5lib**: Advanced HTML processing libraries.
- **python-dotenv**: Secure configuration management.

## How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
```env
API_KEY=your_langchain_api_key
```

### Step 3: Execute the Main Script
Run the project with:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 4: Visualize Results
Optionally, use Streamlit for a user-friendly dashboard:
```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Support for More File Formats**: Export data to Excel, JSON, and databases.
- **Enhanced AI Models**: Use fine-tuned models for domain-specific parsing.
- **Improved UI**: Create a robust frontend with advanced visualization.
- **Scalability**: Enable distributed scraping for large-scale applications.
